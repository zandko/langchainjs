    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    ":::info Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Chat Models](/docs/concepts/#chat-models)\n",
    "- [Prompt Templates](/docs/concepts/#prompt-templates)\n",
    "- [Chat History](/docs/concepts/#chat-history)\n",
    "\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll go over an example of how to design and implement an LLM-powered chatbot. \n",
    "This chatbot will be able to have a conversation and remember previous interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this chatbot that we build will only use the language model to have a conversation.\n",
    "There are several other related concepts that you may be looking for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Conversational RAG](/docs/tutorials/qa_chat_history): Enable a chatbot experience over an external source of data\n",
    "- [Agents](/docs/tutorials/agents): Build a chatbot that can take actions\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will cover the basics which will be helpful for those two more advanced topics, but feel free to skip directly to there should you choose.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "To install LangChain run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{=mdx}\n",
    "import Npm2Yarn from \"@theme/Npm2Yarn\"\n",
    "\n",
    "<Npm2Yarn>\n",
    "  langchain\n",
    "</Npm2Yarn>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details, see our [Installation guide](/docs/how_to/installation).\n",
    "\n",
    "### LangSmith\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls.\n",
    "As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent.\n",
    "The best way to do this is with [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "After you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=\"true\"\n",
    "export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=\"...\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quickstart\n",
    "\n",
    "First up, let's learn how to use a language model by itself. LangChain supports many different language models that you can use interchangably - select the one you want to use below!\n",
    "\n",
    "```{=mdx}\n",
    "import ChatModelTabs from \"@theme/ChatModelTabs\";\n",
    "\n",
    "<ChatModelTabs openaiParams={`model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\"`} />\n",

If left unmanaged, the list of messages will grow unbounded and potentially overflow the context window of the LLM. Therefore, it is important to add a step that limits the size of the messages you are passing in.\n",

First, let's define a function that will modify the messages passed in. Let's make it so that it selects the 10 most recent messages. We can then create a new chain by adding that at the start."
