# Summarize Text

A common use case is wanting to summarize long documents.
This naturally runs into the context window limitations.
Unlike in question-answering, you can't just do some semantic search hacks to only select the chunks of text most relevant to the question (because, in this case, there is no particular question - you want to summarize everything).
So what do you do then?

To get started, we would recommend checking out the summarization chain, which attacks this problem in a recursive manner.

- [Summarization Chain](https://js.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/chains/popular/summarize)

## Example

Here's an example of how you can use the [RefineDocumentsChain](https://js.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/chains/document/refine) to summarize documents loaded from a YouTube video:

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import LoadDocuments from "@examples/use_cases/youtube/podcast_summary.ts";

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/anthropic
```

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{LoadDocuments}</CodeBlock>
