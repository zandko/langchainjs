    "\n",
    "PDF files often hold crucial unstructured data unavailable from other sources. They can be quite lengthy, and unlike plain text files, cannot generally be fed directly into the prompt of a language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you'll create a system that can answer questions about PDF files. More specifically, you'll use a [Document Loader](/docs/concepts/#document-loaders) to load text in a format usable by an LLM, then build a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to answer questions, including citations from the source material.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will gloss over some concepts more deeply covered in our [RAG](/docs/tutorials/rag/) tutorial, so you may want to go through those first if you haven't already.\n",

    "\n",
    "First, you'll need to choose a PDF to load. We'll use a document from [Nike's annual public SEC report](https://s1.q4cdn.com/806093406/files/doc_downloads/2023/414759-1-_5_Nike-NPS-Combo_Form-10-K_WR.pdf). It's over 100 pages long, and contains some crucial data mixed with longer explanatory text. However, you can feel free to use a PDF of your choosing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've chosen your PDF, the next step is to load it into a format that an LLM can more easily handle, since LLMs generally require text inputs. LangChain has a few different [built-in document loaders](/docs/how_to/document_loader_pdf/) for this purpose which you can experiment with. Below, we'll use one powered by the [`pdf-parse`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pdf-parse) package that reads from a filepath:"
